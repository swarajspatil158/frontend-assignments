          <h1>What Every React Developer Should Know About State</h1>
          <p>
              <pre>
                One of the most important concepts for every React developer
                to understand is state what it is, how to properly use it, and
                how to avoid common pitfalls as you build your applications.

            <h3>1. State updates with useState are not merged</h3>
            <p>
              One challenge many React developers face when moving from class-based
              components to function components with React hooks is that state
              updates using objects are no longer automatically merged. A great
              advantage of the useState hook is that we are able to call it as many
              times as we like to use as many state variables as we need.

            <h3>2. State hooks trigger a re-render, useRef does not</h3>
            <p>
              React state has a very important relationship with rendering
              components. Whenever we return JSX from a React component, when that
              component is used, it will be rendered and therefore displayed in our
              application. React takes care of this rendering process. If our
              component uses any state, we must understand that it needs to be
              rendered again that is, re-rendered in response to any state update.
