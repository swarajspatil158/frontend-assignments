            <li>
              In this recipe, I have used the combination of wheat flour and
              maida in a 2:Â½ ratio which gives a perfect texture to poli. Having
              said that, it can also be prepared with just wheat flour or maida
              flour.
            </li>
            <li>
              Secondly, once the chana dal is cooked with jaggery, pass it
              through a sieve to mash it uniformly.
            </li>
            <li>
              I would not recommend using the masher to mash it as it may be
              uneven.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lastly, the poli can be stored and preserved for 1-2 weeks in the
              refrigerator.
            </li>
            <li>
              before serving, heat it in the microwave or in a pan for 60-90
              secs.
            </li>
